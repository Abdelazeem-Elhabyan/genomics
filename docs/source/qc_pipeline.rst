Running the QC pipelines
========================

Core utilities
**************

There are two core QC scripts:

* `solid_qc.sh`: runs the QC pipeline for csfasta and qual file pair
  (fragment mode) or pair of pairs (paired-end mode) generated by a SOLiD
  instrument (solid2fastq, fastq_screen, solid_preprocess_filter and
  qc_boxplotter).

* `illumina_qc.sh`: runs the QC pipeline for fastq (or fastq.gz) file
  generated by an Illumina instrument (fastq_screen and FASTQC).

There is also a script runner program is `run_pipeline.py`, which is used to
run the scripts on multiple sets of files and which performs various job
management operations (such as job submission to Grid Engine).
